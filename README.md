Flappy Bird Clone
===
<sup>by NinjaGhost</sup>


I was looking for an excuse to play around with Java once again after my stint with MonoGame and C#. I've known about LibGDX for a long time but at the time I originally found it I scoffed at it, for reasons I can no longer remember. 

This disgusting mess that is this code is released for fun. I hadn't even really considered open sourcing the code, no one in their right mind should see it. It is a train wreck in there, and I have almost no desire to clean it up at this stage. But if you're a struggling indie game dev looking to see how someone accomplished certain things in a flappy bird clone, if it can somehow manage to help even just one person figure something out, the public embarassment will have been worth it. 

You can download the game (preferably) at the [Itch page](https://ninja-ghost.itch.io/flappy) where the analytics for the download help my page grow.
